# Function Name: Conditions_RemoveSignals_Longer_Shorter_Than

Example: VAN.IP21.291FT6126/CALC=Conditions_RemoveSignals_Longer_Shorter_Than("ShorterThan", 10)

    ' Script Purpose: This script processes an input 0/1 signal and filters out signals
    '                 based on their duration. It outputs 1 when the signal starts and
    '                 0 when the signal ends, based on a specified duration threshold.
    '
    ' Input Arguments:
    ' - durationType (String): Determines whether to filter signals "ShorterThan" or "LongerThan"
    '                           the given duration threshold.
    ' - duration (Double): The duration threshold in minutes. Signals that do not meet the 
    '                      specified duration criteria will be filtered out.
    '
    ' What the Script Does:
    ' - Reads a 0/1 signal from an input tag.
    ' - For each signal (from 1 to 0), calculates its duration in minutes.
    ' - Depending on the "durationType" argument, it filters out signals that are shorter 
    '   or longer than the specified duration threshold.
    ' - Outputs a 1 when the signal starts (becomes 1) and a 0 when the signal ends (becomes 0),
    '   but only for signals that pass the duration filter.

# Function Name: LowHighPassFilter

Example: VAN.IP21.291FT6126/CALC=LowHighPassFilter("LowPass", 600, 0, 0)

    ' Script Purpose: This script implements high-quality FIR filters using the windowed-sinc method.
	'
	' FILTER TYPES:
	' - LOW PASS: Removes high-frequency noise, keeps slow trends
	' - HIGH PASS: Removes slow drifts, keeps fast variations
	'
	' INPUT ARGUMENTS:
	' - FilterType (String): Required. "LowPass" or "HighPass"
	'     LowPass: Smooths signal, removes oscillations faster than CutoffPeriod
	'     HighPass: Removes slow trends, keeps oscillations faster than CutoffPeriod
	'
	' - CutoffPeriod (Double): Required. The cutoff time period in SECONDS.
	'     Example: 600 = 10 minutes, 3600 = 1 hour
	'
	' - FilterOrder (Double): Number of filter coefficients.
	'     Default: 0 (auto-calculated as 4× cutoff period in samples)
	'
	' - SamplingInterval (Double): Output sampling time step in SECONDS.
	'     Default: 0 (auto-calculated from input data density)

Function Name: Conditions_Event_Around_Start_End

Example:
VAN.IP21.SomeSignal/CALC = Conditions_Event_Around_Start_End("Around_Start", 5, 10)
or
VAN.IP21.SomeSignal/CALC = Conditions_Event_Around_Start_End("Around_End", 15, 5)

	Script Purpose

	This script processes a binary 0/1 signal and creates new artificial events around either the start or end of each real signal event.
	The output consists of a 1 at the beginning of the generated event window and a 0 at its end, shifted by user-defined offsets.

	Input Arguments

		Around_Type (String)
			Determines whether to generate the artificial event around the start or around the end of each real signal.
			Accepted values:
			"Around_Start"
			"Around_End"

		Before_event (Double)
			Number of minutes before the real event time (start or end) where the artificial event should begin.

		After_event (Double)
			Number of minutes after the real event time (start or end) where the artificial event should end.

	What the Script Does

		Reads the raw 0/1 signal from the input tag across the calculation period.
		Detects each signal event:
		Start = transition from 0 → 1
		End = transition from 1 → 0
		For each completed real event:
		If Around_Type = "Around_Start":
		Creates a new event starting Before_event minutes before the real signal start.
		Ends the event After_event minutes after the real signal start.
		If Around_Type = "Around_End":
		Creates a new event starting Before_event minutes before the real signal end.
		Ends the event After_event minutes after the real signal end.
		Writes two output points for each generated artificial event:
			1 at the adjusted event start time
			0 at the adjusted event end time
		Does not stretch or modify the original signal—only generates new, shifted event windows.
