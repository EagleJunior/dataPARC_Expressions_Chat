Below are examples of typical pitfalls

1. Multiple Tag Switches
Example: VAN.PI.CALC/EXPR=C.IIF(..., 1, 0)/CALC=Conditions_RemoveSignals_Longer_Shorter_Than("ShorterThan", 15)

CRITICAL RULE VIOLATION
Manual Section 9.1 & 12.3:
Only ONE switch can be applied at a time.

Problem: Expression uses both /EXPR= AND /CALC= on the same tag (illegal).

Valid Workarounds
Option 1: Nest /CALC Inside IV()
VAN.PI.CALC/EXPR=C.IIF((C.StateNo(IV("Tag1/CALC=Conditions_RemoveSignals_Longer_Shorter_Than(&quot;ShorterThan&quot;, 15)")) = 2) OR ..., 1, 0)
Move /CALC= inside IV() for input tag
Use &quot; for nested quotes (Section 9.4)

Option 2: Two-Stage Calculation
Stage 1:
VAN.PI.CALC_TEMP/EXPR=C.IIF(..., 1, 0)
Stage 2:
VAN.PI.CALC_TEMP/CALC=Conditions_RemoveSignals_Longer_Shorter_Than("ShorterThan", 15)

2. Setting constant explicitely
Example: VAN.PI.CALC/EXPR=100 - this won't work as there is no input tag and there is no indication at which points to calculate the output (this is dictated by input tag and all the arguments, the rule is calc to all times)
Example: VAN.PI.InputTag/EXPR=100 0 this will work in Script Editor, but doesnt work in Trends, syntaxis is not supported

Valid Workarounds:
The one I know is to multiply the tag by zero and add a constant: VAN.PI.InputTag/EXPR=IV*0+100
